  -for locating the face (encompassing it into a square), and marking facial features on the face to compare to

  -and "how to" work with dlib
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/04/13/opencv-age-detection-with-deep-learning/
  -potential ways to detect age
  -one possible is cascades (opencv)
 https://pypi.org/project/py-agender/
  -can detect age and gender
  -may not be as accurate as other applications though

Basic dlib model:
- maps an image to a 128 dim vector space
- calculates euclidean distance between target and inputted image
  - if the distance is < 0.6 it is determined to be a match

Neural network:
- weights for various facial features are adjusted based on importance
- each vector starts as a unit vector and after training, becomes an adjusted 128 - component vector
- each component represents probabilitistic outcomes in proximity to different images

Variations:
- can adjust the ML model we use to train the data (maybe use scikit-learn's SVM implementation instead of dlib's provided one)
- can vary how many times the model is resampled (increasing this is a multiplier for time needed to run the model)
